Discovered a new Cryptography algorithm

 Hello Everyone, I had studied information system security subject in my 7th Semester.I have seen almost all algorithms (Symmetric,Asymmetric )
 both of them having Encrypted Message in English alphabets only .So I need to change the encrypted Message into Some other different languages were one cant able to understand it when some one get the encrypted Message .Its like adding security layer for the security.I think may be it simple but i get my satisfaction here.
